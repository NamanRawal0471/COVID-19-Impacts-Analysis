📊 As part of a datathon organized by Manipal University Jaipur, TAPMI School of Business, and the Department of Data Science & Engineering in collaboration with E-Cell and the Data Science Society (Sofia, Bulgaria), I worked on a comprehensive analysis of the global impacts of COVID-19 on public health and the economy.
🌍 Key Areas Covered:

Analyzed global COVID-19 trends using data visualization techniques (line charts, scatter plots, bar charts, bubble charts, and maps).
Explored the relationship between government interventions (stringency index) and case growth across various countries.
Investigated economic impacts, particularly the relationship between GDP per capita and COVID-19 death tolls.
Created an interactive Power BI dashboard showcasing critical insights.
🔍 Key Insights:

Stricter government measures generally curbed case growth but also caused significant economic challenges.
Economically weaker countries faced higher health and economic impacts due to fragile healthcare systems and slower recovery rates.
This analysis provides valuable insights for future crisis preparedness and recovery strategies, emphasizing the importance of resilient healthcare systems and targeted economic policies.
